## Philosophy

Reading is one of the best ways to improve language comprehension — yet it can be hard to stay focused when every sentence feels like a puzzle. This minimalist tool streamlines Japanese book reading with quick comprehension assistance when needed, so you don't lose the narrative thread and stay engaged with the text.

Follow these principles to get the most out of it:

***Translate to verify, not to cheat.*** Read a paragraph, form your understanding, then check the translation to confirm you got it right. This active process builds real comprehension.

***Leave notes for your future self.*** Mark tricky grammar, save useful vocabulary, or jot down questions for your next langauge lesson. Your annotations stay with the text, ready when you return.



## Features

- **Clean Reading** — Distraction-free interface with customizable fonts, sizes, and themes
- **Paragraph Translation** — On-demand translation to verify your understanding. Chrome users can use Google Translate for free (no API key required). Much better translation quality with OpenAI (gpt-5.2) is also available with an [API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).  
- **Personal Notes** — Annotate any paragraph; notes persist locally
- **Progress Memory** — Automatically saves your position in each book
- **Offline Storage** — Everything stored in your browser



## Local Deploy

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), drop in an EPUB, and start reading.

By default, you'll find a fragment of *The Tale of Genji* (源氏物語) to explore the features. The rest of the EPUB is on you to find — read what you like!
