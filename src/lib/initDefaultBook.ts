The nyōgo who had entered court confident that they themselves were the ones, relying on the power of their parents and brothers, resented her as an impertinent woman. The kōi, of equal rank or lower, had all the more reason to let the flames of jealousy burn. Morning after morning, when she withdrew from the night watch quarters of His Majesty's residence, and night after night when she alone was summoned again, the others saw it with their own eyes and heard it with their own ears, and their mortified resentment took its toll: many a kōi, growing frail and anxious, would often retreat to her family home. And as that happened, the Emperor seemed ever more drawn to this one woman alone, unable to show the least restraint no matter what people might say. It had come to a state that might even leave a dark blot on the pages of history that record an emperor's sacred virtues. High officials and courtiers alike were at a loss; though they waited for him to come to his senses, his indulgence was such that they adopted an attitude of wanting, for the time being, to look the other way. In China, too, it was whispered that the appearance of such a favored consort—the Yang family woman—had brewed disorder. Now this woman was being deemed a trouble to the whole realm. Who could say when the post station of Mawei might be reenacted? Even amid an atmosphere so painful it seemed unbearable, she lived on, relying only on the depth of his love. Her father, a Dainagon, was already dead. Her widowed mother, a well-born woman of sound judgment, could serve as a good protector, ensuring her daughter did not fall behind the daughters of the powerful, glittering houses of the day. Even so, as a mere kōi without the backing of great ministers, she always seemed to feel helpless whenever anything arose.";
